## Windows

You'll need Python 3.

To run a Python script in Windows, you must provide the full path to the Python executable. If you're in the repo directory, the relative path to the script is sufficient.

`C:\path\to\python.exe C:\path\to\password.py`

You can simplify this command by adding Python to your PATH.

`python.exe password.py`
